## Introduction

***

Do you have a hard time keeping track of your slice files for your 3D printer? Slice Tracker can help you:
* Organize your slices
* Keep track of the time each one will take to print
* Keep track of how much material will be used by each print
* Keep track of how much material you have left
* Send prints to your printer via octoprint (?)
